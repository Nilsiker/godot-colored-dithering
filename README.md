This is a minimal plugin that introduces a custom ColoredDithering node, to easily scaffold games with a colored dithering shader.

## Usage

Start by registering the plugin under *Project > Project Settings > Plugins*. Make sure **Enabled** is checked!

Add the ColoredDithering node to your scene. Control nodes in the scene placed before the ColoredDithering node will be subject to the shader effect.
